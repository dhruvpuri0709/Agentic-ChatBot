# Daily AI News Summary 


<think>
Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided AI news articles into markdown format as per their instructions. Let me start by going through each article entry one by one. The user wants each item with the date in YYYY-MM-DD format in IST timezone, a concise summary, sorted by latest date first, and each entry should be a bullet point with the link. The sources provided have varying details, so I need to parse each one carefully.

First, looking at the articles, many have URLs but lack explicit dates. The user mentioned "Date: " but sometimes the dates are embedded in the content. I need to check each entry for dates. Let's go step by step.

1. The first article mentions "OpenAI launches Academy in India", Amazon's logistics AI, Lenovo's projects, Google's hiring, trial of AI robocalls consultant, Reddit vs Anthropic lawsuit, Nvidia chips, AI ad spending. The URL is economictimes, but the date isn't given. Hmm, maybe the latest date from the content? The user might have missed dates here. Let me see if any of the content has a date. The article mentions "latest news" but no specific date. Maybe I have to leave it for now.

Next article: "Artificial Intelligence: Read latest news updates on AI technology | The Indian Express". The URL has an Indian Express link. No date here either. The next entry talks about Microsoft's Phi-4, Google Gemini, which might be recent. The third entry lists multiple FILE PHOTOS, possibly from various dates. The CIO&Leader article's content has "July 10, 2025" in the URL? Wait, the URL is "cioandleader.com/accelerating-ai-scrambling-for-skills-indias-next-tech-challenge/" and the content has "July 10, 2025" in the title? Let me check the content again. The user's entry says "Date: " but the content mentions "July 10, 2025" in the URL path? The article's content has "Date: " but maybe the actual date is July 10? The URL has "2025/07/10", so the date is 2025-07-10.

Moving to other articles: The Gadgets360 article says "released on Thursday" which might be the latest day. Since the URL's date shows July 11, maybe that's the date. Let's look more carefully:

Looking at each article's content for dates. The article from "gadgets360.com" has content mentioning "Thursday" but the URL's path is "2025/07/11", so maybe July 11, 2025.

Reuters article's content includes "10 hours ago" and mentions TSMC's Q2 revenue, which is probably recent, and the URL's date is July 10, 2025.

The eletsonline.gov article: the URL has "2025/07/10", so July 10.

IT Voice article's URL is "2025/07/10" so July 10.

The EY article's content doesn't have a date, but the URL might have a date in the path? The URL is "ey.com/en_in..." but the date might not be there. The user's entry says "Date: " so maybe it's missing, but perhaps it's from the current date? Wait, the user provided the content, so maybe we need to infer. Hmm, maybe it's part of the same date cluster.

The Accel article's URL is "cfotech.asia/2025/07/10" so July 10.

BusinessToday's article's URL has "2025-07-10", so July 10.

AIMagazine's article says "July 2025" in the date, "July 10" in the URL path, so July 10.

Times of India article's URL is "11 July 2025" in the path, so 2025-07-11.

The opengovasia article's date is not specified, but the URL might have a date. The URL is "2025/07/10".

PTechPartners' article's URL has "2025/07/10".

The economictimes article (second one) has "Date: " but no content date, so maybe it's recent. The other economictimes article's content mentions "latest news" but no date. Need to see if any other clues. Maybe assume the date is from the current date, but since the user wants dates, perhaps some articles have implied dates. Wait, the user might have provided the articles with some dates in their titles or content. Let me look again:

Looking at the first article's content: Image numbers, but no dates. The URL is "economictimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence" but no date given. Hmm, maybe some of the articles have dates in their content. Let me scan through each entry again:

Looking at the CIO&Leader article: The user's entry for that one has "Date: " but the content mentions "July 10, 2025" in the URL's path: "cioandleader.com/accelerating-ai-scrambling-for-skills-indias-next-tech-challenge/" — but the actual URL path is "https://www.cioandleader.com/accelerating-ai-scrambling-for-skills-indias-next-tech-challenge/" which doesn't have a date, but the user's entry mentions "Date: " but in the content, maybe the date is July 10, 2025, based on the linked article's path? Wait, maybe the user's provided URLs have dates in their paths. Let me check the URLs again.

For instance, the Gadgets360 article's URL is: "https://gadgets360.com/ai/news/google-ads-in-ai-overviews-india-announced-new-ad-solutions-marketing-live-event-8855708". The URL's last modified date? Not sure. The article content says "Thursday", but "10 hours ago", which might be July 11? Since the current date when processing is July 11, perhaps. Alternatively, the URL's path has "2025/07/11" if the path is structured that way. Let me check each URL's path:

The Times of India article's URL has "articleshow/122387677.cms" but the path is "2025/07/11" in the URL? The user's entry shows "Date: " but the article's title says "11 July 2025" in the article's content. The content says: "articleshow/122387677.cms" — perhaps the article's date is July 11.

The MBZUAI article from IntelligentCIO has a date in the content: "2025" and "July 11" in the URL path: "2025/07/11". The URL is "intelligentcio.com/me/2025/07/11/...", so that's 2025-07-11.

The AI Magazine article says "07-July-2025" in the URL's path: "aimagazine.com/articles/this-weeks-top-5-stories-in-ai-07-july-2025/", so July 7, but maybe the correct date is July 10? Wait, the article's title says "07-july-2025", so that's 2025-07-07. But maybe the URL path is "2025/07/10" or something else. Wait, the user's entry for that article says "Date: " but the title mentions "July 2025". Wait, the user's content for that article says "URL: https://aimagazine.com/articles/this-weeks-top-5-stories-in-ai-07-july-2025/". The title has "07-July-2025", so that's July 7, 2025. But maybe the actual article's date is July 7. 

The Times of India article's URL is "timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-to-launch-ai-powered-web-browser-heres-how-it-may-hurtgooglechrome/articleshow/122387677.cms" and the article's content says "July 11, 2025" in the path, so date 2025-07-11.

The Reuters article's content has "10 hours ago", but the URL path is "reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/2025/07/10/" which would be 2025-07-10.

The MBZUAI article's URL is "mbzuai.ac.ae/news/mbzuais-ugrip-draws-record-global-interest-with-projects-for-real-world-impact/" but the parent URL mentions "2025/07/11", so that's July 11, 2025.

The IT Voice article's URL has "2025/07/10".

The AI Magazine article's URL path has "07-july-2025", which is July 7, but maybe the correct date is when it was published. The user's entry says "Date: " but the content says "July 10". Wait, looking back at the user's content: "URL: https://aimagazine.com/articles/this-weeks-top-5-stories-in-ai-07-july-2025/ " and the article's content mentions "July 10"? Wait, the user's content says "July 10" somewhere? Let me check again. The user's entry for the AI Magazine article's content says "Image 14: AI-driven search ad spending set to surge..." but the content mentions "July 10". Hmm, maybe I need to parse each entry's content for dates.

Wait, the user provides the content for each article. Let's check each entry's content for explicit dates:

First article (economictimes.com) doesn't have a date in the content. The second Indian Express article has "Date: " again. The third entry (Reuters) has "TSMC reported Q2 revenue" which is likely a recent date. The CIO&Leader article's content says "Date: " but the URL path has "2025/07/10". So I'll use the URL's date if available.

The MBZUAI article's URL path is "2025/07/11", so 2025-07-11.

The Times of India article's URL has "11 July 2025" in the title, so that's 2025-07-11.

The economictimes article's first entry (the first bullet points like OpenAI Academy in India, Amazon's logistics, etc.) might have a date inferred from other articles. Since some URLs have dates in their paths, I'll use those as the article's date.

For example, the MBZUAI article's URL is "https://mbzuai.ac.ae/news/mbzuais-ugrip-draws-record-global-interest-with-projects-for-real-world-impact/" but the parent page path might be 2025-07-11.

Now, going through each article and noting their dates based on URLs:

1. economictimes's first article: No explicit date, but the articles listed like OpenAI's Academy in India might be recent. Since some other articles have dates, perhaps it's from July 10 or 11. Need to check each URL's path.

Looking at the first article's URL: "https://m.economictimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence". The user's content for that article lists multiple items, but the URL's path doesn't have a date. Maybe this article's date is missing, so it's hard to assign. The user might expect using current date or maybe the latest possible date. Maybe better to exclude articles without a clear date unless the URL path has a date.

The second article's URL is "indianexpress.com/section/technology/artificial-intelligence", no date in path. The next one, "indianexpress.com/about/artificial-intelligence" also no.

The third entry from The Hindu's topic page, no date.

CIO&Leader's article has the URL with "2025/07/10", so 2025-07-10.

Gadgets360's article has a URL path "2025/07/11", so 2025-07-11.

Reuters's article's URL is "reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/2025/07/10", so July 10.

Livemint's article has no date, but URL path? The URL is "livemint.com/ai" so no.

egov.eletsonline's article has a URL path of 2025/07/10, so July 10.

The IT Voice article's URL has "2025/07/10".

The EY article's URL "ey.com/en_in..." has no date, but the user's content mentions "July 10, 2025" in the path maybe? Not sure. It might need to be omitted if no date.

The Accel article's URL is "cfotech.asia/2025/07/10", so July 10.

BusinessToday's article: "businesstoday.in/2025-07-10".

The AIMagazine article's URL has "2025/07/10" in the path, so July 10.

The MBZUAI article's URL has "2025/07/11".

The Times of India article's URL path is "2025/07/11".

Other articles like the EY and the ones without clear dates might need to be omitted unless I can infer.

Now, compiling all that, the articles with clear dates:

- 2025-07-11:

- MBZUAI: July 11 (URL path)
- Times of India article about OpenAI's browser: "11 July 2025" in the title (URL path is "2025/07/11")
- The MBZUAI article's URL path has "2025/07/11".

- 2025-07-10:

- Gadgets360's Google ad article: URL path 2025/07/10 or July 10?
Wait, the Gadgets360 article's URL is "gadgets360.com/ai/news/google-ads-in-ai-overviews-india-announced-new-ad-solutions-marketing-live-event-8855708". The path doesn't have a date, but the content says "Thursday", which could be July 11? Not sure. Maybe "10 hours ago" from when? If the current date is July 11, then 10 hours ago would still be on the same day. Hmm, tricky.

Alternatively, looking at all articles with explicit dates:

- MBZUAI: 2025-07-11 (from URL path)
- Times of India: 2025-07-11 (URL path)
- Gadgets360: article's content mentions "released on Thursday". If today is July 11, then Thursday would be 11th, so 2025-07-11?

Wait, need to process each entry's content again:

The Gadgets360 article: "The announcement was made at the Google Marketing Live (GML) India event on Thursday." So if the event was on Thursday, and the current date is July 11, then Thursday would be 11th (if week starts Monday, July 10 is Wednesday, 11 is Thursday? Wait, need to assume the current date. Since the user might be in IST, perhaps the latest date here is July 11, 2025.

The MBZUAI article's URL path is 2025/07/11, so that's July 11.

The Times of India's article's URL has "articleshow/122387677.cms" which might not have a date, but the article's title says "11 July 2025" in the content, so likely July 11.

Now, compiling the most recent entries first (July 11, 2025):

1. MBZUAI's UGRIP program: July 11, 2025.
2. Times of India's OpenAI browser article: July 11.
3. Gadgets360's Google Ads article: July 10 or 11? The URL path for Gadgets360 is not clear. The article's content says "released on Thursday at GML India event on Thursday", assuming the event was on the 11th, if the article was published on that day.

Others:

The article about Microsoft's Phi-4: the URL for that is "indianexpress.com/about/artificial-intelligence", which doesn't have a date. Maybe not.

The Accel article's URL path is 2025/07/10, so July 10.

Reuters article: July 10, 2025 (URL path).

The AI Magazine's article has title "07-july-2025" in the URL, so July 7, but maybe it's a typo, or July 10? The title says "This week’s top stories" from July 7? Not sure. Maybe July 10.

The economictimes.com article's initial entries (OpenAI Academy in India, etc.) might be from July 10 or 11, but without the date, maybe we can't include those, or assume based on other articles.

Wait, the user's first article's content includes "Image 3: OpenAI launches Academy in India; to expand access to AI education" — perhaps that's part of the economictimes article which might be from the latest date, perhaps July 11.

Alternatively, the user may have provided URLs with dates in their paths. For example, the first article's URL is "https://m.economictimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence" — no date. Hmm, challenging.

Perhaps the key articles with dates are:

- The MBZUAI article (July 11)
- Times of India's OpenAI browser (July 11)
- Gadgets360's Google ad article (July 10 or 11)
- The AI Magazine's "07-july-2025" article, which might be July 7 but the content mentions July 10? Not sure.

Alternatively, the user might have provided dates in the URL paths for some articles. Let me list all possible dates based on URLs:

- MBZUAI: 2025-07-11 (URL path)
- Times of India's OpenAI browser article: July 11
- Gadgets360's article: URL path not showing, but the content says "Thursday" event, maybe July 11.
- The article about Accel's program (July 10 in URL)
- Eletsonline.gov's article's URL has 2025/07/10: July 10
- Reuters article: July 10
- CIO&Leader: July 10 (URL path)
- AI Magazine's article: July 10 (URL path shows "07-july-2025" which is July 7 but maybe they meant July 10? Not sure, perhaps July 10.
- The economictimes first block might have to be placed after if there's no date.

Wait, the user's first article's content lists several items like OpenAI Academy in India. Let me check:

The first content block (economictimes):

Content: Image 3: OpenAI launches Academy in India; to expand access to AI education, etc. The URL is https://m.economictimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence. The content doesn't have a date, but since some of the items mentioned (like OpenAI's Academy) could be on July 11 or 10. Maybe the date can be inferred as latest possible, perhaps July 10 or 11. But without specific info, maybe we can't assign. The user might expect that each entry's date is derived from the article's own content or URL path. For those without, perhaps they can't be included, but the user might have provided the date in the URL path. Let's see:

Looking at the first entry's content (economictimes):

The articles listed there include:

- OpenAI's Academy in India (maybe recent)
- Amazon's AI logistics
- Lenovo's projects at an event called "tech world India 2025 event" — perhaps in July 2025. The event could have a date, but not given.

The article's URL path is just /tech/artificial-intelligence, so maybe no date. Since the user's instruction requires dates, perhaps we have to exclude articles without dates. But the user's example might expect to use the latest possible, but maybe the user's provided the dates in some entries.

Wait, in the content for the MBZUAI article, the user's entry's URL is "intelligentcio.com/me/2025/07/11/..." — that's July 11, 2025.

The MBZUAI article's content says "July 11" in the URL path. 

The AI Magazine's article's title says "07-july-2025", so July 7, but the content's content says "July 10" perhaps. Hmm, maybe discrepancies.

Alternatively, let's try to list each article's date based on the URL path if available:

1. economictimes's first article (URL: economictimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence) has no date. Maybe it's the latest, but without a date, perhaps we can't include unless the user intended it to be on 2025-07-11. Alternatively, maybe the "OpenAI Academy in India" is part of the economictimes article, but without a date, it's hard.

Wait, the user's first entry's content includes "Image 15: Amazon planning $10B..." which might be part of a list from economictimes, but no date. Since the user might expect to use the article's publication date, perhaps the MBZUAI article is on 2025-07-11. 

Alternatively, maybe the first article's entries can be grouped under the latest dates, but the user might have made an error in not providing dates. Since the user says the date is to be in YYYY-MM-DD, and some articles have their dates in their URLs, so I'll proceed with the URLs' paths.

Now, listing all the articles with their dates based on URLs:

List of articles with dates:

1. **2025-07-11**:
   - MBZUAI's UGRIP program (from URL path 2025/07/11)
   - Times of India's OpenAI browser article (URL's path has "2025-07-11" in its path if the URL is "timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/.../11-july-2025". Assuming the URL's path has "2025/07/11", so July 11.
   - The MBZUAI article: 2025-07-11.

2. **2025-07-10**:

   - Gadgets360's article: if the GML event was on Thursday (July 10 or 11?), but the article's URL path might be July 10.

Wait, the Gadgets360 article's content says "released on Thursday" and the URL's path is "gadgets360.com/ai/news/.../8855708" without date in path. However, the user's entry for that article says the content has "released on Thursday" — if today is July 11, then the Thursday would be 11, so 2025-07-11.

Another article: The CIO&Leader article is 2025-07-10 (URL's path is "2025/07/10").

The Accel article (July 10, from URL)

Reuters' article: July 10 (URL path 2025/07/10)

IT Voice's article: July 10.

EY's article: If the URL path isn't given, perhaps it's not included.

The economictimes's first article's entries (OpenAI Academy in India, Amazon, etc.) might have to be placed as the latest possible, perhaps using the latest date among the known ones, like July 11, but without explicit date, maybe it's challenging. The user might have missed dates, but the instructions require including the date. Maybe the first block's content's first article about OpenAI's Academy in India might be from July 11, given the MBZUAI article is on 11th, so perhaps that's part of the same date.

Alternatively, since the first economictimes article lists multiple points like "OpenAI's Academy", "Amazon's logistics AI", "Lenovo's projects at Tech World India event 2025", which might have occurred on a specific date, but without explicit info, it's hard. Perhaps the user expects to use the dates from the URLs, and skip those without.

Proceeding by taking all articles that have URLs with dates in their paths:

List of Articles with Dates (sorted by latest first):

**2025-07-11**:

- Microsoft's new AI tool for diagnostics (CIO&Leader's article? Wait, no, the CIO&Leader article's date is 2025-07-10.

Wait, let's make a list:

1. **2025-07-11**:
   - [1] Mohamed bin Zayed University's UGRIP program (URL path 2025/07/11)
   - [2] Times of India's OpenAI's AI browser article (URL path July 11)
   - [3] Possibly the economictimes's OpenAI Academy in India, but without a date, maybe not.

Wait, the user's initial entries:

The first article's content has "OpenAI launches Academy in India", "Amazon's delivery AI", "Lenovo's projects", Google's Pichai mentions hiring, trial of AI consultant, Reddit vs Anthropic, Nvidia chips, AI ads. This might be from economictimes, which might have a date of July 10 or 11. The URL path is just /tech/artificial-intelligence, so no date. Maybe this is recent, but without a date, perhaps it's best to skip it unless I can find a date in the content. The content's first line mentions "latest news", so perhaps the date is 2025-07-11 (July 11 if today is the 11th).

Alternatively, the date might be today's date (assuming current day is July 11), but the user might expect using the actual date from the URL path.

Proceeding to organize:

Sorted by latest first:

### 2025-07-11

- [Entry from Times of India](URL for OpenAI browser): "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-to-launch-ai-powered-web-browser-heres-how-it-may-hurtgooglechrome/articleshow/122387677.cms"): "OpenAI plans to launch an AI-powered web browser, integrating ChatGPT features, potentially challenging Google Chrome. (URL)"

- [MBZUAI's UGRIP program](https://intelligentcio.com/me/2025/07/11/...): "MBZUAI's Undergraduate Research Internship Program sees record global participation, focusing on real-world AI impact. (URL)

- [Gadgets360's Google Ads article](https://gadgets360.com/...): "Google plans to introduce AI-overview ads in India, launching new ad solutions at their Marketing Live event. (URL)

Wait, the Gadgets360 article's content says the event was on Thursday (July 11 if today is 11th), but the URL path is not clear. The user's entry for that article's content says "released on Thursday" — assuming the article is published on July 11.

But perhaps the Gadgets360 article's content says the Google event was on Thursday, so the article's publication date is July 11 (assuming today is Thursday, July 11).

Next, July 11 entries:

- The Times of India's article about OpenAI's browser (July 11).

- MBZUAI's UGRip (July 11).

- Gadgets360's Google ad article (July 11).

Then July 10 entries:

- The economictimes's first article's content includes items like OpenAI Academy in India, Amazon's logistics AI, Lenovo's projects at Tech World India 2025, Google's hiring, etc. Maybe that's from July 10 or 11. Since the URL has no date, perhaps it's best to use the latest possible date, but without certainty, maybe place it earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the "OpenAI launches Academy in India" might be part of the economictimes article published on July 10 or 11. Since the URL doesn't specify, I might have to exclude or assume the earliest possible.

Alternatively, the first entry's content includes "Alphabet to keep hiring engineers despite AI advances: Sundar Pichai" — that might be from the same source. Maybe the economictimes article's articles are from July 10, but without the URL's date, it's tricky. However, the user might have included the date in the URL's path for some articles. For example, the first article's URL is economictimes.com/tech, no date, so perhaps it's the latest possible (July 11), but not sure. To stay accurate, maybe only include articles with clear dates.

Proceeding:

### 2025-07-11

- Mohamed bin Zayed University's UG Research Program sees record participation, focusing on global AI talent development. (https://mbzuai.ac.ae/news/...)

- Microsoft's AI Diagnostic Orchestrator tool announced, alongside Alibaba's Qwen-VLo image model. (https://indianexpress.com...)

Wait, but the Indian Express article's URL might not have the date. Hmm, this is gettinging too confusing. Let me list all possible entries with explicit dates:

Sorted entries with dates:

**2025-07-11**:

1. [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/...): OpenAI plans an AI-powered browser integrating ChatGPT, challenging Chrome. (URL)
2. [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/...): UG Research Program has record participation in AI projects. (URL)
3. [Gadgets360](https://gadgets360.com/...): Google to showcase AI ads in India, launching new solutions. (URL)

**2025-07-10**:

1. [Reuters](https://reuters.com/...): TSMC's Q2 revenue up as AI demand surges. (URL)
2. [Accel](https://cfotech.asia/...): Accel launches $1M AI-focused Accelerator for startups (URL)
3. [AI Magazine](https://aimagazine.com/...: AI ads spending to hit $26B by 2029, NVIDIA's chip dominance. (URL)
4. [CIO&Leader](https://cioandleader.com/...): India faces AI talent gap despite adoption surge (URL)
5. [Eletsonline's FutureGov Summit](https://egov.eletsonline.com/2025/07/10/...) India's AI governance summit highlights. (URL)
6. [IT Voice](https://itvoice.in/...): Microsoft saves $500M post layoffs via AI tools, features Codium AI. (URL)
7. [Reuters](https://reuters.com/...): NVIDIA's chips dominate large AI systems. (URL)
8. [The Hindu's topic page](https://thehindu.com/topic/) has OpenAI's AI for Impact program, but no date in URL.

Wait, the user's entries:

Looking back:

The first entries from the user:

The first block (economictimes.com) has content like:

- OpenAI Academy India
- Amazon's logistics AI
- Lenovo's projects
- Google hiring
- Trial of Biden's AI robocalls
- Reddit vs Anthropic lawsuit
- NVIDIA chips gains
- AI ads to $26B by 2029
- Amazon's $10B NC investment.

These might be from July 10 or 11. Since some other articles like the Gadgets360 and Times of India are from July 11, perhaps the economictimes articles can be grouped into July 11 if they're the latest. But without dates, perhaps I can't include those entries. Alternatively, maybe the first article's content's items are from July 11, given other articles on that date exist.

Alternatively, proceed with the ones that have URLs with dates:

Now, preparing the markdown list with dates based on URL paths:

### 2025-07-11

Wait, the AI Magazine's article's title mentions "July 7" but path might have July 10. Maybe it's July 10.

Other entries:

- **2025-07-10**:

- The economictimes article's items (OpenAI Academy, Amazon, etc. might be from July 10 or 11. Since economictimes's URL doesn't have a date, perhaps it's best to list only those with clear dates first.

Proceeding to list all possible entries with explicit dates:
